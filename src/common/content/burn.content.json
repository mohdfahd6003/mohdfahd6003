Cool the burn area immediately with cold, but not ice-cold, water for at least 10 minutes. If you do not have cold water, use a cool or cold, but not freezing, clean compress. Run cold water on the burn until it doesn't hurt. You may then cover the burn with a dry, nonstick sterile or clean dressing. The only things you should put on a burn are cold water and clean dressings. If the pain persists, see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. I hope your patient feels a little better.
