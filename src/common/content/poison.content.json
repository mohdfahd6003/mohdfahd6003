Look for signs that warn you that poisons are nearby. Look for spilled or leaking containers. If the scene seems unsafe, do not approach. Tell everyone to move away. If the scene is safe, get the first aid kit and AED. Then call your local emergency number. Tell the dispatcher the name of the poison if you know it. Follow the dispatcher's instructions and ask to be connected to the Poison Control Center for more information. Remain with the person until advanced help arrives. What else can I help you with?"
