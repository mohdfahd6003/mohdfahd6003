Have the person sit and lean forward. Pinch the soft part of the nose on both sides with a clean dressing, clean cloth or a tissue. Place constant pressure on the nostrils for a few minutes until the bleeding stops. If bleeding continues, press harder. <break time='1s'/> You're doing great! But, if you can't stop the bleeding in about 15 minutes, call your local emergency number. You should also call your local emergency number if the bleeding is heavy, such as gushing blood, or if the injured person has trouble breathing. Feel free to ask me about Burns, Dehydration or Choking. What else can I help you with?"
